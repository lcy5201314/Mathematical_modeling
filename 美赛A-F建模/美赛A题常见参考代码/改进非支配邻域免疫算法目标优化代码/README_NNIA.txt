NNIA toolbox for Matlab 7.0 designed by Maoguo Gong and Licheng Jiao includes NNIA for solving multiobjective function optimization problems. This package contains a MATLAB implementation of the Multiobjective Optimization algorithms as described in:

Maoguo Gong, Licheng Jiao, Haifeng Du, Liefeng Bo. Multiobjective Immune Algorithm with Nondominated Neighbor-based Selection. Evolutionary Computation Journal, MIT Press, 2007, in press.
avialable from http://see.xidian.edu.cn/iiip/mggong/publication.htm

To use it copy all five files
    {EMOinstruction.m, getbud.m, NNIA.m, OVcom.m, and README_NNIA.txt}
to a directory in your MATLAB path or the current directory in your MATLAB environment. Then, in MATLAB just type
NNIA;
to get an illustrative example or 
help NNIA;
to get help on the usage of the ToolBox.
