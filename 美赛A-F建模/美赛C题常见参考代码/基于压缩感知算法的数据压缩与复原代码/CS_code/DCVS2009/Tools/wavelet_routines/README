520.646 Wavelets & Time-Frequency Analysis - Spring 2000
		Trac D. Tran

In this package you will find:

1. dwt1d, idwt1d: forward & inverse 1D discrete wavelet transform
2. dwt2d, idwt2d: forward & inverse 2D discrete wavelet transform
3. lphd, lphr: fast forward & inverse 2D discrete wavelet transform;
               requiring linear phase filters.
4. lpdec, lprec, lphdec, lphrec: supporting routines
5. mydisplay: function to display a grayscale image
6. psnr: function to compute the PSNR & MSE between 2 signals
7. boat: 8-bit grayscale image of a nice boat. You are welcome to
         use other interesting images!
