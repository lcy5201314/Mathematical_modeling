The following files are basic implementations of the
GaBP algorithm.

1) gabp.m - GaBP algorithm for dense matrices, parallel version

algorithm described in:
Linear Detection via Belief Propagation
By Danny Bickson, Danny Dolev, Ori Shental, Paul H. Siegel and Jack K. Wolf.
In the 45th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control and Computing, Allerton House, Illinois, 
Sept. 07'
1a) run_gabp.m - example script for running gabp.m
2) asynch_GBP.m - GaBP algorithm for dense matrices, serial (asynch. version)
3) sparse_gabp.m - GaBP algorithm for sparse matrices, optimized.
This code was tested with instances of size 500,000 x 500,000 with 4% non zeros
3a) run_sparse_gabp.m - script file for running sprase_gabp.m
4) gabpms.m - Min-Sum algorithm
C.C. Moallemi and B. Van Roy. Convergence of the min-sum algorithm for convex optimization.?
4a) run_gabpms.m - script for running the gabpms.m file
5) gabp_inv.m - runs GaBP for inverting a matrix
5a) run_gabp_inv.m - script for running gabp_inv

The following directories include samples of problems solved using GaBP.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1) LDLC - extended low density lattice decoder
This codes needs the KDE Matlab package by A. T. Ihler, found in http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~ihler/code/
After unpacking, you should addpath() in Matlab to the root kde directory.
