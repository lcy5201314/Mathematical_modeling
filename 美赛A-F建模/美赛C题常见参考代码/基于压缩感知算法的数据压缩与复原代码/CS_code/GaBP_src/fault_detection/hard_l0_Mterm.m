%
%   stopTol: Value for stopping criterion.

% Description
%
%   Implements the M-sparse algorithm described in [1], [2] and [3].
%   This algorithm takes a gradient step and then thresholds to only retain
%   M non-zero elements. It allows the step-size to be calculated
%   automatically as described in [3] and is therefore now independent from 
%   a rescaling of P.
