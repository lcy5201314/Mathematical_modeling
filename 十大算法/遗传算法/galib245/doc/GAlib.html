There are two mailing lists to which you may subscribe, and an address to which you should report bugs.
<blockquote>
<dl>
  <dt>galib@mit.edu
  <dd><small>This is an unmoderated mailing list for GAlib users.  If you have found use for GAlib and would like to let other users know about it, or if you're having problems with GAlib, post it to this mailing list and one of the other subscribers just might be able to help you out.  I read all messages that are posted to this list, but I cannot respond to every one.</small>
       <br>
       <br>
  <dt>galib-announce@mit.edu
  <dd><small>This mailing list is for announcements about updates to GAlib.  The only messages sent to recipients of this list are announcements from me about revisions to GAlib.  This typically amounts to about one or two emails per year.</small>
       <br>
       <br>
  <dt>galib-bugs@mit.edu
  <dd><small>This is where you should send bug reports.  Please check the list of <a href="http://lancet.mit.edu/ga/Bugs.html">known bugs</a> before you submit a bug report.  You cannot subscribe to this list.</small>
