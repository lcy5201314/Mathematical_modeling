GAlib: A C++ Genetic Algorithm Library
Copyright (c) 1994-1996 MIT, 1996-2000 Matthew Wall

GAlib is a C++ library of genetic algorithm objects.  With GAlib you can add 
evolutionary algorithm optimization to almost any program using any data 
representation and standard or custom selection, crossover, mutation, 
scaling, and termination methods.  

The library requires a cfront 3.0 compatible C++ compiler.  I have tested 
GAlib on MacOS using Metrowerks and Symantec development environments, 
DOS/Windows using Borland C++ and MS VC++, and various UNIX platforms using 
g++, egcs, CC, and DCC.

Graphic examples (XWindows/Motif and MS Windows) are available, as are 
parallel, distributed implementations using PVM.  There are about 30 examples
that illustrate various ways to use GAlib on a variety of problems.

DOCUMENTATION, UPDATES and MAILING LIST ---------------------------------------

Complete documentation in html format is available in the doc directory.  The 
FTP site contains PDF and PostScript(tm) versions.  For the most recent 
installation hints, bug fixes, and announcements, see the documentation at 
http://lancet.mit.edu/ga/

There are two GAlib mailing lists:  galib@mit.edu and galib-announce@mit.edu
The first list is an unmoderated list intended as a forum for galib users to
help each other.  The second is only for announcements about GAlib updates.
To subscribe, send email to galib-request@mit.edu (or galib-announce-request)
with the word 'subscribe' as the subject and nothing in the body of the email.
To unsubscribe, send email with the word 'unsubscribe' as the subject.

WHERE TO GET IT ---------------------------------------------------------------

The source for this library is ftp://lancet.mit.edu/pub/ga/
Packages for MacOS, Windows, and UNIX are at the FTP site.  The source code
is the same for all platforms.  Makefiles for UNIX and Windows are included in
the standard distribution.  Projects for MacOS and Windows compilers are 
available at the FTP site in the project_files directory.  Graphic examples
for windows are available as separate downloads in the files gademo.zip and
tspdemo.zip.

COMPILATION -------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two things to build: the library and the examples.  You can build
galib as a standalone library (static or shared).  Here is the overview; if
you need more information, see Installation.html in the doc directory.

 UNIX -------------------------------------------------------------------------

   % make
   % make install

   You might want to modify makevars and ga/gaconfig.h.

 Win 95/NT --------------------------------------------------------------------

   > nmake /f makefile.win32

   You might want to modify makevars.win32 and ga/gaconfig.h.  If you plan to
   use galib with MFC then be sure to define NO_STREAMS.

 MacOS ------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The codewarrior5 project builds right out of the box.  The project files
   are in the directory project_files on the ftp site.

BUGS 'n STUFF -----------------------------------------------------------------

A current list of bugs is at http://lancet.mit.edu/ga/Bugs.html

Send bug reports and suggestions for improvements to galib@mit.edu.  When 
submitting a bug report, please include the GAlib version number, machine
type, operating system and version number, and events that led up to you 
finding the bug.
